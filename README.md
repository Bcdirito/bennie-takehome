# Brian DiRito Bennie Takehome

The following repository contains my code for the Bennie takehome code-challenge. It is built with React and uses the following libraries:

* React Router Dom
* Sass

The application supports mobile, tablet, and desktop design and was styled using mobile-first design practices.

### Application Instillation

* Navigate to the `bennie-takehome` directory
* Run `npm install`.

### ENV Variables

* Navigate to the root directory and create a file named `.env`
* Inside of said file, add `REACT_APP_CALLOUT_URL="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"`
* If your server is currently running, please restart it for `.env` files to take effect

### Running the Application

To run the application you can simply run `npm start`. The application will be hosted at `http://localhost:3000/`.

If you have any questions, please reach out, and I will be happy to answer them!

Enjoy!
